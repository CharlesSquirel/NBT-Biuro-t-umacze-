This is a minimalist website - a business card for a person providing translation services from English.

## Description

This is actually my first, fully commercial project, which I supervised from idea and design to final deployment. It came out of the need of my dear friend, for whom I made it.

I invited a designer to cooperate with me, who, like me, is learning her craft and collecting projects for her portfolio. At this point I would like to thank her very much.

The website is supposed to be minimalist, business card-like with a certain number of subpages and a contact form.

I decided to use Next due to its native SEO optimization and possible future expansion of the project with CMS and internationalization. This technology also proved helpful in issuing a simple API for nodemailer.

## Technologies
